## Build Example

This is an example of how you can handle CodeQL scans for a polygot repo. The build example in here runs scans against:

1. C++ using a manual build

2. Java using a manual build

3. C# using a manual build

This code base can be expanded upon to add examples of vulnerabilities that get tagged by CodeQL.
