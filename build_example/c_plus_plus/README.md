# C++ Project

This is a C++ project that consists of the following files:

- `src/main.cpp`: This file is the entry point of the C++ application. It contains the main function where the program execution starts. Add example security issues here for testing COdeQL

- `src/utils/helper.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of a helper function or class that can be used in the `main.cpp` file or other source files.

- `include/helper.h`: This file is a header file that declares the functions or classes defined in the `helper.cpp` file. It provides the interface for using the helper functionality.

- `CMakeLists.txt`: This file is the CMake configuration file for building the C++ project. It specifies the source files, include directories, and any additional dependencies or libraries required for building the project.

Feel free to explore the source code and make any modifications or additions as needed.

Happy coding!
